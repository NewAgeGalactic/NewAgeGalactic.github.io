    <h1>Learn Laviera</h1>
    <p>in order to learn laviera, there are rules that you must follow. </p>
    <p>the first one that is common is   
        <p>laviera's vowels</p>
    
    
        <ul>
            <li>ay</li>
            <li>eh</li>
            <li>ie</li>
            <li>oh</li>
            <li>ue</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>these make up the basics of laviera, but there is still one left to learn.</p>
    <p><a href="doubel.html">double letters</a>. double letters allow laviera to do translation from english to laviera and vice versa to be way easier</p>
    <div>
        <ul>laviera's double letters rules goes as follows
            <li>
                    when 2 letters of the same type are next to each other, say "ll", instead of saying "lele", it will be read as "leh"
             </li>
            <li>
                double letters can and will appear in words from english and laviera.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>it's not a rare accurance that words will be shortened and because of that we have double letters to help!</p>       
        <p>now that we have got the basics out of the way. lets go to the words section of laviera!</p>
